📞 AI-Powered Loan Recovery Bot using Flask, Twilio, and Whisper
This project is an AI-driven voice bot developed for the Loan Recovery Department of Axis Bank. It automates outbound calls to customers, asks a series of loan-related questions using natural speech, and uses Whisper (for transcription) and an LLM (OpenChat) for intelligent response flow. The interaction is stored and analyzed for compliance, and data is logged into a CSV for further review.

🌟 Features
📲 Twilio Integration for voice call handling.
🧠 LLM-powered conversation flow using OpenChat.
🗣️ Real-time speech-to-text using OpenAI’s Whisper.
📁 Auto-saves user responses to a CSV file.
🎤 Voice output using Amazon Polly (Aditi) for natural-sounding Hindi-English voice.
🧾 Loan recovery logic flow embedded in assistant.
✅ Fully automated — the system makes the call, runs the flow, and logs the results.

🧰 Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Ngrok (for exposing localhost to Twilio)
Twilio account with a verified number
ffmpeg installed on your system
Whisper and torch installed via pip
⚙️ Installation
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-loan-recovery-bot.git
cd ai-loan-recovery-bot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install ffmpeg (if not already)
sudo apt install ffmpeg         # For Linux
brew install ffmpeg             # For macOS

# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in your Twilio credentials and phone numbers
.env Sample
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1XXX...
TARGET_PHONE_NUMBER=+91XXXX...
🧪 Running the App
Step 1: Start Flask Server
python app.py
Step 2: Start Ngrok (in separate terminal)
ngrok http 5500
Update the ngrok_url in make_initial_call() with the new HTTPS URL generated by Ngrok.

Step 3: Twilio Call Begins Automatically
Once the server runs, it automatically makes a call using Twilio to the number provided in .env.

🔁 Call Flow Breakdown
/voice

Entry point for Twilio call
Starts intro message and redirects to /ask_next
/ask_next

Calls ask_question() to ask a predefined question from the bot
/process

Downloads recorded audio
Converts .mp3 → .wav
Uses Whisper to transcribe speech
Uses OpenChat LLM to determine how to respond or re-ask
/save

Callback from Twilio when recording completes (no logic here)
📒 Question Flow Logic
The bot asks 4 questions:

Name
Is this your linked loan number?
What was your loan amount?
Did you repay the loan on time?
Based on responses:

If a user says “No” to timely repayment → triggers a warning message
If irrelevant input → repeats same question
If complete → thanks and ends call
💾 Data Storage
All responses are saved in a file called loan_recovery_data.csv with the following columns:

Timestamp	Call SID	Name	Linked Number	Loan Amount	Repaid On Time
🗣️ Voice and Transcription
Bot uses Amazon Polly's Aditi voice (Hindi-English female).
Audio is recorded and transcribed using Whisper (base model).
The bot understands and responds intelligently using OpenChat LLM via a locally running instance.
📦 Dependencies
You can create a requirements.txt file like this:

Flask
requests
twilio
whisper
python-dotenv
openai-whisper
And install with:

pip install -r requirements.txt
🛑 Limitations
LLM (/process) assumes a local OpenChat instance at http://localhost:11434/api/chat.
No database is used; CSV is the only log.
Doesn't support incoming calls (only outbound).
🚀 Deployment Ideas
☁️ Deploy on a server or cloud VM
🔄 Schedule calls in batches
📊 Export CSV to CRM or database
🌐 Host LLM on cloud or container for scalability
🙋 FAQ
Q: What if the user gives incomplete or unrelated responses? A: The LLM detects relevance using keywords and context. If irrelevant, it repeats the question.

Q: Is the call two-way voice or just keypad-based? A: It is two-way voice — the system uses STT (Whisper) and TTS (Polly).

Q: Can this work without Ngrok? A: Yes, but you’ll need a public URL (via cloud or domain).
