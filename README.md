# 📞 AI-Powered Loan Recovery Bot using Flask, Twilio, and Whisper

This project is an **AI-driven voice bot** developed for the **Loan Recovery Department of Axis Bank**.
It automates outbound calls to customers, asks a series of loan-related questions using natural speech, and uses **Whisper** (for transcription) and an **LLM (OpenChat)** for intelligent response flow.

The interaction is stored and analyzed for compliance, and data is logged into a CSV for further review.

## 🌟 Features

* 📲 **Twilio Integration** for voice call handling.
* 🧠 **LLM-powered conversation flow** using OpenChat.
* 🗣️ **Real-time speech-to-text** using OpenAI’s Whisper.
* 📁 **Auto-saves user responses** to a CSV file.
* 🎤 **Natural-sounding Hindi-English voice** via Amazon Polly (Aditi).
* 🧾 **Embedded loan recovery logic** for intelligent follow-ups.
* ✅ **Fully automated** — makes the call, runs the flow, logs the results.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Ngrok (for exposing localhost to Twilio)
* Twilio account with a verified phone number
* ffmpeg installed on your system
* Whisper and torch installed via pip

---

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-loan-recovery-bot.git
cd ai-loan-recovery-bot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install ffmpeg (if not already installed)
sudo apt install ffmpeg         # Linux
brew install ffmpeg             # macOS

# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in your Twilio credentials and phone numbers
```

### `.env` Sample

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1XXX...
TARGET_PHONE_NUMBER=+91XXXX...
```

---

## 🧪 Running the App

**Step 1:** Start Flask server

```bash
python app.py
```

**Step 2:** Start Ngrok (in separate terminal)

```bash
ngrok http 5500
```

Update the `ngrok_url` in `make_initial_call()` with the new HTTPS URL generated by Ngrok.

**Step 3:** Twilio call begins automatically
Once the server runs, it automatically makes a call to the number provided in `.env`.

## 🔁 Call Flow Breakdown

### `/voice`

* Entry point for Twilio call.
* Starts intro message and redirects to `/ask_next`.

### `/ask_next`

* Calls `ask_question()` to ask a predefined question from the bot.

### `/process`

* Downloads recorded audio.
* Converts `.mp3` → `.wav`.
* Uses Whisper to transcribe speech.
* Uses OpenChat LLM to determine how to respond or re-ask.

### `/save`

* Callback from Twilio when recording completes (no main logic here).

---

## 📒 Question Flow Logic

The bot asks **4 questions**:

1. Name
2. Is this your linked loan number?
3. What was your loan amount?
4. Did you repay the loan on time?

**Logic:**

* If user says “No” to timely repayment → triggers a warning message.
* If irrelevant input → repeats the same question.
* If complete → thanks and ends call.

---

## 💾 Data Storage

All responses are saved in `loan_recovery_data.csv` with columns:

| Timestamp | Call SID | Name | Linked Number | Loan Amount | Repaid On Time |
| --------- | -------- | ---- | ------------- | ----------- | -------------- |

---

## 🗣️ Voice and Transcription

* **TTS:** Amazon Polly's "Aditi" voice (Hindi-English female).
* **STT:** Whisper (base model) for transcription.
* **LLM:** OpenChat API (local) for intelligent response flow.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Example `requirements.txt`:

```
Flask
requests
twilio
whisper
python-dotenv
openai-whisper
```

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🛑 Limitations

* LLM (`/process`) assumes a local OpenChat instance at `http://localhost:11434/api/chat`.
* No database is used — CSV is the only log.
* Only supports outbound calls (no incoming call support).

---

## 🚀 Deployment Ideas

* ☁️ Deploy on a server or cloud VM.
* 🔄 Schedule calls in batches.
* 📊 Export CSV to CRM or database.
* 🌐 Host LLM on cloud or in containers for scalability.

---

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q:** What if the user gives incomplete or unrelated responses?
**A:** The LLM detects relevance using keywords and context. If irrelevant, it repeats the question.

**Q:** Is the call two-way voice or just keypad-based?
**A:** It is two-way voice — the system uses STT (Whisper) and TTS (Polly).

**Q:** Can this work without Ngrok?
**A:** Yes, but you’ll need a public URL (via cloud or domain).
